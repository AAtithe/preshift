# Preshift Rota

The rota built by finance people who have run hospitality floors. A joint venture between
Williams, Stanley & Co. and [Preshift](https://preshift.co.uk/).

Every rota tool on the market answers "who is working when". Preshift answers the question an
operator actually cares about: "what will this week's labour cost me against what I will take,
and is it legal". It builds the rota from the sales forecast, costs every shift the way payroll
will, blocks anything that breaks UK employment law, and hands finance a ready-to-post labour
accrual so the P&L carries true labour before payroll has even run.

## What is in this first build

| Area | What it does | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Demand-led build | Turns hourly forecast sales and covers into headcount per role (sales per labour hour or covers per person, with floors and caps), then fills the gaps peak-first, cheapest legal person first, and trims overstaffed edges. Gaps it cannot fill legally are reported as a hiring or cross-training signal. | `src/engine/demand.ts`, `src/engine/autoschedule.ts` |
| True cost per shift | Gross pay, holiday accrual (12.07%), employer NI at 15% over the £96 weekly threshold, auto-enrolment pension on qualifying earnings, guaranteed contracted hours. On-costs are worked on the whole week then spread over shifts, so the rota reconciles to payroll. | `src/engine/cost.ts`, `src/engine/ukRates.ts` |
| Marginal cost | The shift editor shows what a shift adds to the week, not a naive rate x hours. Someone on guaranteed hours costs nothing extra; someone already over the NI threshold costs 15% more than the headline rate. | `src/ui/ShiftEditor.tsx` |
| UK compliance | Working Time Regulations breaks, 11 hour daily rest (across week boundaries), weekly rest, 48 hour average without opt-out, young worker limits (8h/day, 40h/week, 30 minute break, 12h rest, night work), minimum wage by age, double booking, leave, availability, training. Blocking issues stop publication. | `src/engine/compliance.ts` |
| Live labour % | Forecast sales, loaded labour, labour % against the site target, pound variance, SPLH, by day and week. | `src/engine/metrics.ts`, `src/ui/KpiBar.tsx` |
| People | Employee records: details, employment dates, roles, contract and pay, right to work, availability and leave. Each record is checked before it reaches the rota: right to work missing or expired, pay below the legal minimum, upcoming birthdays that move the minimum wage band, salaried pay that falls below minimum wage at maximum hours, under 18 opt-outs, auto-enrolment eligibility. Starters and leavers are pro-rated in cost, kept off the auto-build outside their dates, and exported for payroll. | `src/engine/employees.ts`, `src/ui/PeopleView.tsx`, `src/ui/EmployeeEditor.tsx` |
| Rota assistant | The GM tells it what they need in plain English ("Ben is off Saturday, re-cover the bar without going over target") and Claude drafts the week by calling the engine's own tools. Every shift it proposes is costed by the payroll model and checked by the compliance engine; anything with a blocking issue is refused, so it cannot roster illegally. The GM sees labour % before and after, the changes, and a short note on gaps and trade-offs, then applies or discards the draft. | `src/ai/rotaTools.ts`, `src/ai/rotaAgent.ts`, `src/ui/AssistantPanel.tsx` |
| Close | Labour accrual journals by role nominal and site tracking category, one per entity, from approved actuals once available, otherwise the rota, exported in Xero manual journal format. | `src/engine/journal.ts`, `src/ui/CloseView.tsx` |
| Multi-site | Group and entity views put every site side by side with entity subtotals and a sales-weighted group target. One press builds every site in scope: each site's own team first, then cover from people who have agreed to work other sites. Cross-site cover is reported each week. | `src/engine/metrics.ts`, `src/engine/autoschedule.ts`, `src/ui/GroupView.tsx` |
| Multi-entity | Sites trade in an entity and people are employed by one, which need not be the same (a central employing company, or cover at a sister company's site). Cost lands where the work was done; the wages accrual stays with the employer; the difference posts as an intercompany recharge on both sides, checked to agree before posting. | `src/engine/types.ts`, `src/engine/journal.ts` |
| Payroll per PAYE scheme | Each company has its own TeamPay employer. Starters, leavers and approved hours go to the scheme of the company that employs the person, wherever they worked; hours go as one batch per company, and each pay run comes back to its company and is reconciled against that company's accrual only. Nothing is sent until every company with hours has an employer, and moving a synced person between schemes is refused because it is a leaver and a starter. | `server/payrollEmployers.ts`, `server/routes/payroll.ts`, `server/outbox.ts` |
| Employment Allowance | One claim per connected group, set on the claiming entity with what the last payroll left unused. Used against that entity's employer NI week by week until it runs out, as payroll applies it, and posted to its books only (Cr employer NI, Dr wages accrual) split across its sites. Resets each tax year. Site labour % stays before the allowance. | `src/engine/allowance.ts`, `src/engine/journal.ts` |
| API | Fastify REST API with OpenAPI docs at `/docs`, scoped API keys and per-organisation tenancy. The web app runs entirely on it. | `server/` |
| TeamPay, native | Starters, changes and leavers sync to TeamPay as they are saved. Approved clocked hours go to TeamPay through an idempotent, retrying outbox. Signed `payroll.run.completed` webhooks bring the pay run back and reconcile it to the accrual. | `server/integrations/payroll/`, `server/outbox.ts`, `src/ui/PayrollView.tsx` |
| Time and attendance | Clock in and out (UK wall-clock time, overnight shifts), manual entries, manager approval, rota against clock by person, period locking once sent to payroll. | `server/routes/time.ts`, `src/engine/timesheet.ts` |
| Shift sign-in | Clock in tab for a tablet at the site entrance: staff tap an RFID card (USB keyboard reader, or a phone's NFC on Android Chrome) or sign in by name. Each site can have a geofence; signing in by name on a device must happen inside it, and the location is kept on the time entry. Repeat reads of one tap are ignored. | `src/ui/ClockView.tsx`, `server/routes/clocking.ts`, `src/engine/clocking.ts` |
| Staff app | Staff clock in and out on their own phones at `/staff/`, record their breaks, and see their own published shifts and hours. Breaks are not location checked (they only lower paid time); recorded breaks set the entry's unpaid minutes at clock-out, the phone shows the legal minimum for the shift, and a card tap during a break ends the break. A manager sends a one-time invite link from Clock in setup (valid 7 days; a new one resets a forgotten password). Phone clocking needs the site's geofence, both ways. Staff logins are separate from manager accounts and reach nothing else; closing a login or marking a leaver ends it at once. | `src/staff/`, `staff/index.html`, `server/routes/staff.ts` |

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # API on :8787, web app on http://localhost:5173, API docs on /docs
npm test         # engine and API tests (103 across 7 files)
npm run build    # typecheck and production build
```

Locally, sign in as `dev@preshift.local` with password `preshift-dev-password`. That account only
exists when the API runs without a database, and is never created on the live system.

## Sign in, people and settings

Everything about access is managed inside the app, under Settings. Nothing is configured in
environment variables.

- First run. On a system with no accounts yet, the sign-in page offers "Create the owner account".
  Whoever completes it first becomes the owner (an admin), so do it straight after the first deploy.
  It can only ever happen once, enforced in the database.
- Who can sign in. Separate from the People tab, which holds staff records. Admins add accounts with a first password and a role, reset passwords, change roles and
  remove people. Members use the app but cannot manage access. Every organisation keeps at least
  one admin, and nobody can remove themselves.
- Rota assistant. An admin saves the organisation's Claude API key. It is kept on the server, shown
  afterwards only by its last four characters, and used only for the assistant's own requests (one
  model, capped output). Set a monthly spend limit on it in the Claude Console all the same.
- Your password. Anyone can change their own; doing so signs out their other devices.

Accounts, password hashes (scrypt), the session signing key and the Claude key all live in the
Preshift database. Sessions last 12 hours in an HttpOnly cookie and are checked against the database
on every request, so removing someone or resetting their password takes effect at once. Five wrong
passwords lock an account for 15 minutes. The web app carries no API key: it calls the API with the
session. On Vercel the app's files are served by the API function only to signed-in people. People who
forget their password use "Forgot your password?" on the sign-in page: a single-use link, valid for 30
minutes, is emailed through Resend once an admin saves a Resend key, a from address and the app's address
under Settings. The reply never says whether an account exists, one account gets at most three emails an
hour, and the link's token sits after `#` so it never reaches a server log. Until email is set up, an admin
makes a 24 hour link with "Reset link" and hands it over. Known limit: two roles only.

The demo runs a small group: West End Dining Ltd (Marylebone and Fitzrovia) and East Canteen &
Kitchen Ltd (Shoreditch), with realistic teams, rates and forecasts, against a TeamPay simulator.
A few people cover sister sites, and one Shoreditch bartender covers Marylebone, which is a
cross-company recharge. Choose an entity and site in the top bar, or leave both on "All" for the
group view, and press "Build" to generate the week. The rota assistant and the Payroll tab work on
one site, so they appear once a single site is selected. On the Payroll tab: set people up in
TeamPay, simulate clocking, approve, send hours, run payroll. Set the `TEAMPAY_*` variables to
connect to real TeamPay and `PRESHIFT_DATABASE_URL` for Postgres; see `docs/API.md`, which also
covers the Vercel deployment.

## Deployment (Vercel)

`npm run build:vercel` (set in `vercel.json`) writes `.vercel/output` with the Build Output API:

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | Marketing site, from `site/` |
| `/v1`, `/docs`, `/health` | The API, bundled into one Node function from `server/vercel.ts` |
| `/login`, `/auth/*` | Sign-in, first-run owner setup and sign-out, served by the API function |
| `/app/` | Web app, served by the API function to signed-in people only (`server/routes/web.ts`) |
| `/api/anthropic/v1/messages` | The rota assistant's route to Claude, using the key saved in Settings |
| `/internal/dispatch` | Daily Vercel Cron retry of payroll changes TeamPay has not confirmed (needs `CRON_SECRET`) |

Set `PRESHIFT_DATABASE_URL` to a Neon database that belongs to Preshift and the API keeps its data
in Postgres across cold starts and instances. Without it, data is held in memory and resets when
the function cold starts: fine for a demo, not for customers. Preshift never reads the generic
`DATABASE_URL`, so it cannot write into another system's database by accident. The hosted API has
no public key: people reach it by signing in, and integrations need a key from `PRESHIFT_API_KEYS`.

## Structure

```
src/engine   Pure TypeScript domain logic, shared by API, browser and assistant. Fully unit tested.
src/ai       The rota assistant: tools over the engine, and the Claude loop that drives them.
server       The Preshift API: routes, sign-in, people and settings, API keys, tenancy, Postgres store, payroll outbox, TeamPay client and simulator.
src/ui       React web app, a client of the API.
site         Marketing site (static, no build step).
scripts      Local dev runner and the Vercel build.
docs         API and integration guide, strategy and roadmap.
```

The engine runs in both places: the server is the source of truth, and the browser runs the
same code for instant cost and compliance feedback while editing.

## Statutory rates

All UK parameters live in `src/engine/ukRates.ts` and are set for 2026/27. They change every
April and must be checked against GOV.UK before each tax year.

See `docs/STRATEGY.md` for the competitive position, JV model and roadmap.
